# Flashdex
A Mangadex client written in flash/Actionscript 2.0

## Why?
Why did god create us this way? Why must our souls be ripped from the void, placed in a prison of flesh, and made to suffer?  
Because Adobe™ Flash™ is an amazing new technology set to revolutionise the way we consume content on the World Wide Web!

With Mangadex's critical failure in supporting modern operating systems like Microsoft™ Windows™ 98SE™,
and their refusal to take corrective action (ridiculous!), it has become increasingly obvious that a solution must be forced upon them.

This solution is FlashDex™ for Mangadex.

Designed for speed and efficiency, FlashDex™ makes use of only the latest and greatest version of Actionscript, Actionscript 2.0!
This decision allows for support with modern alternative Flash™ runtimes such as [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/).
